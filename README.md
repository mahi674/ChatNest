ChatNest is built using a modern and efficient technology stack that ensures a robust and scalable chat application:

### MERN Stack:

• MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing user data, messages, and chat history. MongoDB's flexible schema design allows for easy management and retrieval of chat-related data. <br>
• Express.js: A minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides the server-side logic and API endpoints needed for the application. Express.js simplifies routing and middleware management. <br>
• React.js: A powerful front-end library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. React's component-based architecture facilitates efficient updates and state management.<br>
• Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that enables server-side code execution. Node.js handles real-time communications and server operations efficiently.

### Socket.io:

Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server. Socket.io ensures that messages are delivered instantly and efficiently, enhancing the chat experience.

### Redux Toolkit:

Provides a predictable state container for managing application state. Redux Toolkit simplifies state management with features like createSlice, createAsyncThunk, and a built-in DevTools extension.

### Tailwind CSS:

A utility-first CSS framework that offers a customizable and responsive design. Tailwind CSS allows for rapid styling and design adjustments without writing custom CSS.
