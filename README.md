# Technologies Used

ChatNest is built using a modern and efficient technology stack that ensures a robust and scalable chat application:

### MERN Stack:

• MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing user data, messages, and chat history. MongoDB's flexible schema design allows for easy management and retrieval of chat-related data. <br>
• Express.js: A minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides the server-side logic and API endpoints needed for the application. Express.js simplifies routing and middleware management. <br>
• React.js: A powerful front-end library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. React's component-based architecture facilitates efficient updates and state management.<br>
• Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that enables server-side code execution. Node.js handles real-time communications and server operations efficiently.

### Socket.io:

Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server. Socket.io ensures that messages are delivered instantly and efficiently, enhancing the chat experience.

### Mongoose:

Essential for managing data like user profiles, messages, chat rooms, and group memberships. It allows you to define schemas, enforce data validation, and perform CRUD operations efficiently. Mongoose integrates seamlessly with MongoDB, enabling real-time data persistence and retrieval, which is vital for a responsive chat experience.

### Tailwind CSS:

A utility-first CSS framework that offers a customizable and responsive design. Tailwind CSS allows for rapid styling and design adjustments without writing custom CSS.
